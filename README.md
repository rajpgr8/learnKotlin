# learnKotlin

#### Topics
```
1. Lazy delegate: 

Ex: Initilize Calculate() object when it is actuallt required
  private val calculate by lazy {
    Calculate()
  }
  
2. Companion Object (Simiar to static variable in C++), Only one copy is needed at class level and it would be shared accross the class objects.  
While each object has own copy of member varaibles.

3. Asynchronous programming / coroutine / main-safety
